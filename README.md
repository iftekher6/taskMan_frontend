# Task Management App

Welcome to the TaskMan repository! This application is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack and comes with various functionalities to manage your tasks.


## Features

*Authentication: Secure user authentication using Two Roles(Admin and User) system to manage your tasks.

*Create Task: Easily create and publish your task with user-friendly interface.

*Delete Task: Remove the tasks that are no neccessary anymore.

*Update Task:  update your tasks.

## Technical Decisions
MERN Stack: Chosen for its popularity and ease of use in building full-stack applications. Each component of the stack has a specific role that contributes to the overall functionality of the app.
React for Frontend: React was selected for its component-based architecture, which allows for reusable UI components and efficient state management.
Express for Backend: Express was chosen for its simplicity and flexibility in handling HTTP requests and building RESTful APIs.
MongoDB for Database: MongoDB was chosen for its scalability and ability to handle large amounts of unstructured data. Mongoose simplifies interactions with MongoDB through its schema-based modeling.
Component-Based Design: The frontend is designed using reusable components to ensure maintainability and scalability.
RESTful API: The backend follows REST principles to provide a clear and consistent interface for CRUD operations on tasks.
